     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                        The Silicon Detector
                        --------------------

 The detector setup is implemented from the B4c example in the Geant4 basic example set.
 It simulates a simple sampling Calorimeter setup and data scoring is done via Hits and 
 sensitive detectors. The primary generator was modified from a single particle beam to 
 an isotropic source of alpha particles at a pre-specified distance from the detector
 geometry. Currently, most README is modified version of that of the example B4 README:
 https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/blob/master/examples/basic/B4/README
 but will be modified with the changes made.

 The isotropy directory is primarily to prove that the primary generator source is 
 isotropic in nature. This will likely be removed in the fututre and integrated into 
 the detector directory. The detector directory will be used to define the geometry 
 of the Silicon PIN diode detector array.

 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

   The geometry is constructed in B4c::DetectorConstruction class. The 
   calorimeter is a box made of a given number of layers. A layer consists 
   of an absorber plate and of a detection gap. The layer is replicated.

   Four parameters define the geometry of the calorimeter :
	- the thickness of an absorber plate,
 	- the thickness of a gap,
 	- the number of layers
 	- the transverse size of the calorimeter (the entrance face is a square).

   In addition, a global, uniform, and transverse magnetic field can be applied 
   using G4GlobalMagFieldMessenger, instantiated in
     B4c::DetectorConstruction::ConstructSDandField
   with a non zero field value, or via interactive commands.

   For example:
   /globalField/setValue 0.2 0 0 tesla


        |<-------layer 0------->|             |<-------layer N------->|
        |                       |             |                       |
        ===============================================================
        ||              |       ||           ||              |       ||
        ||              |       || N layers  ||              |       ||
 beam   ||   absorber   |  gap  ||.........->||   absorber   |  gap  ||
======> ||              |       ||           ||              |       ||
        ||              |       ||           ||              |       ||
        ===============================================================

   In this case, only one gap and absorber layer (i.e. Layer 0) is utilised 
   to simulate a detector and a backing plate.

 2- PHYSICS LIST

   The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available in 
   this example are set in the FTFP_BERT physics list. This physics list
   requires data files for electromagnetic and hadronic processes.

   See more on installation of the datasets in Geant4 Installation Guide v11.1,
   Postinstall Setup: Environment Variables for Datasets:
   https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/postinstall.html#environment-variables-for-datasets
   The following datasets: G4LEDATA, G4LEVELGAMMADATA, G4SAIDXSDATA and
   G4ENSDFSTATEDATA are mandatory for this example.

   In addition the build-in interactive command:
               /process/(in)activate processName
   allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

 3- ACTION INITALIZATION

   The B4c::ActionInitialization class instantiates and registers to 
   Geant4 kernel all user action classes.

   While in sequential mode the action classes are instatiated just once,
   via invoking the method:
      B4c::ActionInitialization::Build()
   in multi-threading mode the same method is invoked for each thread worker
   and so all user action classes are defined thread-local.

   A run action class is instantiated both thread-local
   and global that's why its instance is created also in the method
      B4c::ActionInitialization::BuildForMaster()
   which is invoked only in multi-threading mode.

 4- PRIMARY GENERATOR

   The primary particle source is an isotropic source of alpha particles of 
   50 MeV energy by default. This is implemented using a procedure found in 
   the TestEm4::PrimaryGeneratorAction::PrimaryGeneratorAction() in example 
   TestEm4 found in:
   https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/tree/master/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm4   

   The type of the particle and its energy are set in the B4::PrimaryGeneratorAction 
   class, and can be changed via the G4 built-in commands of the G4ParticleGun class 
   (see the macros provided with this example).

 5- RUNS and EVENTS

   A run is a set of events.
   The user can choose the frequency of printing via the Geant4 interactive
   command, for example:

     /run/printProgress 100

 6- DETECTOR RESPONSE

   The energy deposit, track lengths and (X,Y,Z) coordinates of the charged 
   particles are recorded on an event by event basis in the Absober and Gap 
   layers.

   The method of data scoring is implemented in 4 ways in B4c. 
   The method relevant to the example B4c is given below:

   Variant c: Hits and Sensitive detectors

     The physics quantities are accounted using the hits
     and sensitive detectors framework defined in the Geant4 kernel.
     The physics quantities are stored in B4c::CalorHit via two B4c::CalorimeterSD
     objects, one associated with the Absorber volume and another one with Gap
     in B4c::DetectorConstruction::ConstructSDandField().

     Contrary to the B2 example (Tracker) where a new hit is created with each 
     track passing the sensitive volume (in the calorimeter), only one hit is 
     created for each calorimeter layer and one more hit to account for the 
     total quantities in all layers. In addition to the variants B4a and B4b,
     the quantities per each layer are also available in addition to the total
     quantities.
     
  7- HISTOGRAMS

   The analysis tools are used to accumulate statistics and compute the dispersion
   of the energy deposit and track lengths of the charged particles.
   H1D histograms are created in B4c::RunAction::RunAction() for the
   following quantities:
   - Energy deposit in absorber
   - Energy deposit in gap
   - Track length in absorber
   - Track length in gap
   - X position in absorber
   - Y position in absorber
   - Z position in absorber
   - X position in gap
   - Y position in gap
   - Z position in gap
 
   The same values are also saved in an ntuple.

   The histograms and the ntuple are saved in the output file in a format
   according to a specified file extension, the default in this example
   is ROOT.

   The accumulated statistic and computed dispersion is printed at the end of
   run, in B4::RunAction::EndOfRunAction().
   When running in multi-threading mode, the histograms and the ntuple accumulated
   on threads are merged in a single output file. While merging of histograms is
   performed by default, merging of ntuples is explicitly activated in the B4::RunAction
   constructor.

   The ROOT histograms and ntuple can be plotted with ROOT using the plotHisto.C
   and plotNtuple.C macros.

 8- HOW TO RUN

    This example handles the program arguments in a new way.
    It can be run with the following optional arguments:
    % exampleB4c [-m macro ] [-u UIsession] [-t nThreads] [-vDefault]

    The -vDefault option will activate using the default Geant4 stepping verbose
    class (G4SteppingVerbose) instead of the enhanced stepping verbose with best
    units (G4SteppingVerboseWithUnits) used in the example by default.

    The -t option is available only in multi-threading mode and allows the user 
    to override the Geant4 default number of threads. The number of threads can 
    be also set via G4FORCENUMBEROFTHREADS environment variable which has the 
    top priority.

    - Execute exampleB4c in the 'interactive mode' with visualization
        % exampleB4c
      and type in the commands from run1.mac line by line:
        Idle> /tracking/verbose 1
        Idle> /run/beamOn 1
        Idle> ...
        Idle> exit
      or
        Idle> /control/execute run1.mac
        ....
        Idle> exit

    - Execute exampleB4c in the 'batch' mode from macro files
      (without visualization)
        % exampleB4c -m run2.mac
        % exampleB4c -m exampleB4.in > exampleB4.out

    - Execute exampleB4c in the 'interactive mode' with a selected UI session,
      e.g. tcsh
        % exampleB4c -u tcsh

 The following paragraphs are common to all basic examples

 A- VISUALIZATION

   The visualization manager is set via the G4VisExecutive class
   in the main() function in exampleB4c.cc. The initialisation of 
   the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands in the macro vis.mac. 
   This macro is automatically read from the main function when the 
   example is used in interactive running mode.

   By default, vis.mac opens an OpenGL viewer (/vis/open OGL).
   The user can change the initial viewer by commenting out this line
   and instead uncommenting one of the other /vis/open statements, such as
   HepRepFile or DAWNFILE (which produce files that can be viewed with the
   HepRApp and DAWN viewers, respectively).  Note that one can always
   open new viewers at any time from the command line.  For example, if
   you already have a view in, say, an OpenGL window with a name
   "viewer-0", then
      /vis/open DAWNFILE
   then to get the same view
      /vis/viewer/copyView viewer-0
   or to get the same view *plus* scene-modifications
      /vis/viewer/set/all viewer-0
   then to see the result
      /vis/viewer/flush

   The DAWNFILE, HepRepFile drivers are always available
   (since they require no external libraries), but the OGL driver requires
   that the Geant4 libraries have been built with the OpenGL option.

   For more information on visualization, including information on how to
   install and run DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp, see the visualization tutorials,
   for example,
   https://conferences.fnal.gov/g4tutorial/g4cd/Documentation/Visualization/G4[VIS]Tutorial/G4[VIS]Tutorial.html
   (where [VIS] can be replaced by DAWN, OpenGL. HepRApp not currently available on above site or geant4 SLAC)

   The tracks are automatically drawn at the end of each event, accumulated
   for all events and erased at the beginning of the next run.

 B- USER INTERFACES

   The user command interface is set via the G4UIExecutive class
   in the main() function in exampleB4c.cc
   The selection of the user command interface is then done automatically
   according to the Geant4 configuration or it can be done explicitly via
   the third argument of the G4UIExecutive constructor (see exampleB4c.cc).
